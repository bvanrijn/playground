Bot API Playground
==================

This code lets you run a Telegram bot locally in your own browser using JavaScript and update the behavior on-the-fly from within the browser. I mainly use this to experiment with the Bot API.

The example includes receiving messages, sending messages, keyboards and using the bot inline. You can easily use other parts of the Bot API using similar code.

You can try it out at <a href="https://bot.netlify.com">bot.netlify.com</a> or download [index.html](index.html) and open it locally.
